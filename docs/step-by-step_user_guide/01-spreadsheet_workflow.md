# Spreadsheet Workflow â€“ Documenting Solar Cell Synthesis and Measurements at HZB

This guide explains how to document your solar cell synthesis at HZB using our standard workflow. This process involves using a spreadsheet to record synthesis details and then uploading the sheet along with your measurement files to the NOMAD data management platform.

## Why do we need this workflow?

Documenting your experiments in a structured way is crucial for several reasons:

- **Reproducibility:** Allows you and others to understand and reproduce your experiments in the future.
- **Data Quality:** Ensures your data is well-organized and properly described, making it more valuable.
- **Data Sharing:** Enables you to easily share your data with colleagues and the wider scientific community.
- **NOMAD Integration:** Ensures your data can be seamlessly integrated into the NOMAD database, making it accessible and searchable for future research.

## The Spreadsheet Workflow

The workflow consists of the following steps:

1. **Planning the Experiment**
2. **Requesting the Spreadsheet**
   - Contact the data stewards: They will provide you with the appropriate spreadsheet template for your specific experiment.
   - Specify your needs: When requesting the sheet, provide details about your experiment (synthesis steps, spinsteps, number of solutes and solvents, etc.) so they can provide the correct template.
   - Alternatively, you can create your own spreadsheet by using the Voila tool (always start with the Experiment Info as the first category).
3. **Filling in the Spreadsheet**
   - See the [Data Entry Guide](./01-spreadsheet_workflow.md#data-entry-guide) for details.

> **Tip:** There is an [alternative method for creating entries in the NOMAD database](../advanced_user_guide/manual_creation_workflow/create_standard_sample.md), but it is more complex and recommended only for workflows not supported by the current spreadsheet.
