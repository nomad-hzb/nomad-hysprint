# Voila Analysis Tools

The data steward team has developed a suite of interactive Voila notebooks (based on Jupyter and Python) to streamline your data management and analysis workflow. These user-friendly tools include:

- **Design of Experiments:** Plan and structure your experimental approach
- **MPPT Analyzer:** Evaluate maximum power point tracking performance
- **Samples Overview:** Get comprehensive views of your research samples
- **EQE Analyzer:** Analyze external quantum efficiency measurements
- **AbsPL Analyzer:** Analyze absolute PL measurements, compare spectra across batches
- **File Uploader:** Simplify the measurement uploading process
- **JV Analysis Tool:** Examine current-voltage characteristics
- **PLI Plots:** Analyze photoluminescence imaging data
- **Sample History:** Track the complete lifecycle of your samples

We are continuing to develop these tools and are open for feedback and ideas!

There is a larger collection of Voila scripts available as well as the option to create your own Voila scripts for your customized visualization and analysis. Check this guide to find out how: [Make Your Own Voila Tool](../advanced_user_guide/make_your_own_voila.md). For further questions on what scripts are available, please contact our team.

> **Stop the voila scripts once you are done with them in order to release resources**

> **Restart the voila script between processes so that the information gets updated**
