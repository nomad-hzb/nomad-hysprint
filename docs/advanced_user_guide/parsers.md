# Advanced: Plugins and Extensibility

The Hysprint plugin is built on top of the NOMAD baseclasses, making it easy to extend and customize for new workflows, instruments, or data types.

## Extending the Plugin

- **Add New Process Steps:**
  - Extend the modular Excel template and update the parser to recognize new process sheets.
- **Custom Measurement Types:**
  - Add schemas and parsing logic for new measurement techniques or file formats.
- **Integration with Other Plugins:**
  - Combine Hysprint with other NOMAD plugins (e.g., for catalysis or electrochemistry) for multi-modal workflows.
