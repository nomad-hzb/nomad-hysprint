# Make Your Own Voila Tool

The Hysprint plugin provides a foundation for building custom Voila-based data entry and analysis tools. Voila turns Jupyter notebooks into interactive web apps, making it easy to create user-friendly interfaces for experiment planning, data validation, and visualization.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Hysprint repository and install dependencies.**
2. **Explore the provided Voila notebooks and Python modules in the `utils/` directory.**
3. **Modify or extend the modular sequence creator to fit your workflow.**
4. **Add widgets for new process steps, parameters, or validation rules as needed.**
5. **Test your app locally with `voila your_notebook.ipynb`.**

## Example Use Cases

- Custom experiment sequence builders for new synthesis routes
- Data validation dashboards for batch uploads
- Visualization tools for process parameter distributions

For more information, see the [Voila documentation](https://voila.readthedocs.io/) and the Hysprint `utils/Voila_tools/` directory for code examples.
