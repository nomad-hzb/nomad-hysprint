# Create Standard Sample

A standard sample is a collection of processes and information which can serve as a baseline in an experimental plan.

First, create some template processes, eg: `wet chemical depositions` as in [create_wet_chemical_deposition.md](create_wet_chemical_deposition.md), or cleaning or evaporation

Then follow the first  steps in [create_entry.md](create_entry.md).
1. Select HySprint_StandardSample as a `built-in schema`

2. Select a substrate by reference (click pen symbol), (this needs to exist first, e.g. ITO on glass, 6 px).  
3. Select a sample architecture  
4. Select some template processes by reference (click pen symbol), which have to be created before. You can filter by a specific upload to find the correct entries
