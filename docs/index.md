# NOMAD HZB Hysprint Plugin

## What is this Plugin?

The Hysprint plugin extends the NOMAD baseclasses to provide specialized schemas, tools, and workflows for the digital representation of synthesis and characterization in thin film solar cell research, with a focus on high-throughput and combinatorial experimentation. Developed at Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin (HZB), it enables standardized, interoperable, and extensible data management for Hysprint workflows, including batch processing, modular Excel data entry, and advanced measurement tracking.

## Key Features

- **Excel-based Data Entry:** Supports modular, user-friendly Excel templates for experiment planning and data capture.
- **Batch and Sample Tracking:** Enables detailed tracking of batches, substrates, samples, and their relationships.
- **Process Documentation:** Captures multi-step synthesis and processing protocols, including cleaning, coating, annealing, and more.
- **Measurement Integration:** Links synthesis history to characterization data (e.g., JV, MPP, EQE).
- **Interoperability:** Built on NOMAD baseclasses for compatibility with other NOMAD plugins and data standards.
