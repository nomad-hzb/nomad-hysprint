You can select:
 - preparation, information on the preparation information needed, 
 - solutes, eg. PbI2
 - solvents, eg. Isoprpanol
 - other solutiion, eg. a similar entry to what you are doing right now
 - additives, similar to solutes, but with a special purpose
 - storage, information on where and for how long the solution was stored
 - properties, some properties, like ph value
 - solution_id, some times a solution is a sample of itself and is characterized in this case

## Preparation
You can set:
- Atmosphere, eg. N2, there are some suggestion but you can type what you want
- Method, eg. stirring
- temperature,
- time
- speed, for some methods the speed is relevant, if not leaveit blank
- solven ratio, this is a free text field, you can fill it as you wish, e.g. 1:3:5 Anisole,Ethanol,IPA
