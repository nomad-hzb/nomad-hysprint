# NOMAD's schema for HZB perovskite research

See [here](https://nomad-hzb.github.io/nomad-hysprint/) for the documentation.

This is a nomad plugin. You can learn more on nomad plugins here: https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/docs/reference/plugins.html

You can find our deployment image here [HZB SE Image](https://github.com/nomad-hzb/hzb-se-image-2) using all needed plugins. 

Please keep in mind that this plugin is developed to be tested in HZB labs. It can serve as an entry point to other labs, just clone it, rename all classes to your needs and adapt the measurement file parsing.
